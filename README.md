KNIME Tess4J Integration
======

KNIME Tesseract Integration via Tess4J (based on KNIP).

This project implements OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionality in 
KNIME by integrating the open source library "tesseract-ocr" (http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/)
using a modified version of the "Tess4J" Java wrapper (http://tess4j.sourceforge.net/).


Current Platform Support
------

This extension currently supports Mac, Windows (32/64 bit) and Linux (32/64 bit) platforms. Please note that not all Linux platforms are currently supported and support for Windows 32 bit is untested.
