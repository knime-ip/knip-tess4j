Hints on compiling tesseract
Author: Jonathan Hale
--------------------------------------

Most parts of the compiling processs are
described in the tesseract wiki on the google
project page. But some minor issues may be
solved by the following hints.

Getting the source from the svn is not explained
here. I assume you already did that.

Before anything for all os/arch
-------------------------------

Apply the two patches in this folder. After svn update, copy
the patches into tesseract folder and then:

svn patch *.patch

Note: "tessdata_prefix_r863.patch" is not needed after revision 907. 
Bug was fixed in tesseract.

Windows
-------

- Make sure you compile all the dependancies.
They are listed in a leptonica file with 
download links. All of these had Visual Studio
Projects (or compatable), which made this pretty 
simple.

- 64 bits != 32 bits. You will have to recompile
all the dependencies for the 64 bit version as well.
This means adding the amd64 build target somewhere in 
Visual Studio or simply selecting it if it already exists.

- one dependancy has to be compiled via console. Not the System Console
in Windows, but the Microsoft Visual Studio developer console. 
Use the x64 console to compile for x64 and x86 for x86

Linux
------

Whenever something fails because of lack of permission, use sudo.
Also make sure you "apt-get install" all the dependancy-dev packages
should also be listed in the leptonica or tesseract library page.


Steps:
1. ./autogen.sh 
Be sure to do this after an svn update of the tesseract
repo again.
2. ./configure --enable-shared
Use enable-shared to get an .so and do not set a prefix, or it will override the
parameter for the tessdata dir in TessBaseInit() [This issue is resolved by tessdata_...r863.patch]
3. make -j4
The parameter "-j4" is not necessary, but speeds things up (muticore usage).
4. make install
Puts stuff where it belongs


As mentioned in 1.: Do all these steps again, after you do svn update. This is because you
need auto configure when files where added/removed in the update.


Have fun! :)

Mac OSX
-------

Install homebrew for apt-get functionality.

Mac has a different compiler called clang. This compiler is recognized by the automake script.
Make sure you follow the Compiling steps of the Unix build:

Steps:
1. ./autogen.sh 
Be sure to do this after an svn update of the tesseract
repo again.
2. ./configure --enable-shared
Use enable-shared to get an .so and do not set a prefix, or it will override the
parameter for the tessdata dir in TessBaseInit() [This issue is resolved by tessdata_...r863.patch]
3. make -j4
The parameter is not necessary, but speeds things up (muticore usage).
4. make install
Puts stuff where it belongs
